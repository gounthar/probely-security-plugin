        Raw Probely API authentication key.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please use the credentialsId field instead, unless you understand the
        security implications of using this mechanism.
        Passing the API authentication token directly is not advised, unless it
        is properly secured using a secret storage mechanism, such as HashiCorp Vault.
